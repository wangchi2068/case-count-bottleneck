# Code: revision experiments for "case-count bottleneck"

To rebuild everything with one command, run `bash run_all.sh --fresh` from this folder (`code/`).
- Inputs: `../data/external/` (see `../data/DATA_MANIFEST.md`) and the vintage growth-null bands in `../vintage_2026-10-20/analysis/r4_results.json`.
- Outputs:
  - `../analysis/parts/*.json`: per-script results with provenance;
  - `../analysis/results.json`: merged results, one record per number with its script, inputs, seed and mode (measured, simulated or analytic);
  - `../figures/{en,zh}/`: figures;
  - `../tables/{en,zh}/`: tables.
- In the published package (`output/case-count-bottleneck/experiment/`), the vintage results file is shipped as `analysis/vintage_r4_results.json`; point `s06_pathogens.py` at it if the hidden `vintage_2026-10-20/` folder is absent. Tables are in `analysis/tables/`; figures are released with the paper.
- Base seed: 20261020. Each script adds its own offset, and each bootstrap records its seed.

Simulation matched to the data; inversion of the calibration line to v_R^impl, with bootstrap and Monte Carlo uncertainty combined; sensitivity over 11 settings; calibrated b/a (A). Multiscale share, ICC, SD by clustering, J-pooling (B). Mandatory vs voluntary reporting: TOST margin share, Δa, IQR ratios, participation (C). Diminishing returns (D). Comparison with the Poisson renewal variance of Parag et al. 2022 (E).

| `s10_polish.py [sim\|fit\|all]` | Final polish. Lag-1 autocorrelation of within-block deviations in data vs simulated panels (M0, AR φ=0.25/0.5, every s09 setting); four new data-matched settings (true GI 2.9 d = lower end of Cowling et al. 2009, admission VMR 1.5 and 2.0, AR φ=0.25); latent balance scale with interval; 90% interval of the v_R^impl ratio for a TOST on [0.8, 1.25]; τ permitted by the 5.3% completeness bound and Proposition 6 levers at that τ. Writes the `polish` part | final polish | ~130 s sim + 2 s fit |
| `s99_collect.py` | Merges the parts into `results.json`. For round-3 parts only, it adds `inputs_sha256` | M8 | <1 s |

| `make_fig3_inversion.py`, `make_fig6_nomogram.py --lang en/zh` | Round-3 Fig 3 (simulation-based inversion) and Fig 6 (design nomogram), from the s09 parts | round 3 | few s each |
| `make_tables.py` | LaTeX tables S1–S7 (en/zh) from `results.json`, plus `tables/manifest.json` | — | <1 s |

## Reused code (sources and changes)

- **`s06_pathogens.py`** ports `growth_weeks` and `build_rows` from the user's `experiment/original/code/r3_c_pathogens.py` and `r3_common.py`. Changes:
  - the state-cluster BCa bootstrap is replaced by the two-way bootstrap;
  - the null bands come from the vintage growth-null rerun instead of hard-coded constants;
  - Holm and BH corrections are added;
  - a rule-window combination is added.
- **`s05_seasons.py`** copies `dl` and `q_profile` from the user's `r4_e_seasons.py`. Changes:
  - the per-season SE is now two-way;
  - S = 3 and S = 4 are reported separately.
- **`cc_common.fit_stat`** reimplements the iterated FGLS of the user's `common.py`. It reproduces a = 0.099055 against 0.099060.
- **Growth-null bands** come from the user's `r4_a_growth_null.py`, rerun unchanged on the 2026-10-20 vintage (`../vintage_2026-10-20/code/`, `run_all.sh` there; 1,386 s on 8 CPU). Copies of its cell output and log are in `../logs/`.
- **Classification variants (M7②)** are read from the vintage `r4_results.json` (`C_classification`, `C_posthoc`). They are not recomputed.

No script calls an LLM API.
